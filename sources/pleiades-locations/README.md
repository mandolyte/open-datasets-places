# Pleiades Data

This has a script that takes the original input downloaded 
(`pleiades-locations.csv`) from their site 
and extracts a subset of the columns into `pleiades.csv`.

There is a script `run.sh` which does this. It uses a CSV
tool from the csv-utils project written by myself.

See the script for a link to the tool.
